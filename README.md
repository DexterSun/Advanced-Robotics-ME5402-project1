# This is the first project of ME5402, AY20/21

## The folder mainly contains two parts: code and report

### Code:
We use MATLAB_R2020b.

'pure_code.m' shows answer code for each question and the relevant functions built by ourselves.

'code_with_plot' helps to generate the graphs that can help better understand the algorithms.

'code_with_GUI' is organised with SIMULINK with a simply user interface.

### Report:
All parts of report are organised based on knowledge basically in class slides and the original algorithm paper.

Thanks all the authors.
